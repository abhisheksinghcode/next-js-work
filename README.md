##✨ Next.js Portfolio | Modern Web Showcase

**Live Site: abhisheksinghcd.vercel.app**

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio and project showcase, built with Next.js for blazing-fast performance and seamless UX. It’s designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to iterate on.

Why?
To showcase my work in a minimal, performant way.

To experiment with Next.js features (App Router, ISR, API routes).

Because Vercel + Next.js is a match made in dev heaven.

##🚀 Quick Start
Clone & Install

bash
git clone https://github.com/abhisheksinghcode/next-js-work.git
cd next-js-work && npm install
Run Locally

bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 to tinker!

Deploy Your Own
Fork this repo, push to GitHub, and import into Vercel for automatic CI/CD.
